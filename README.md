####A minimal breakout clone developed entirely in AIDE on my Moto G.

While bored at local sportsball games where my children were cheerleaders, I entertained myself by developing this small game on my 
Android phone. The Android IDE [AIDE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiiyYmmxM3KAhWG6SYKHdrFAFAQFgguMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.aide.ui%26hl%3Den&usg=AFQjCNHZbh3ybTvw-EBnZsa4vk6dn3Onxw&sig2=B-mj45tWN1YNfKluX6806w) 
comes with easy project templates, and one of them is the [LibGDX](libgdx.badlogicgames.com) game library.
I also created the art assets on-device with the [Photo Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iudesk.android.photo.editor) app.

I wanted to prove the feasibility of total application development on device - I now feel that was misguided. While feasible in the strictest sense,
it was a rather huge pain in the heinie, however this is likely a limitation of my device, not of the tools, which were very capable.
